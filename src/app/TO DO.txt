This document is to provide some direction for matmadness.

1.  Change the name to reflect all sports
2.  HttpInterceptors
3.  concatMap for the returning of the http request
4.  NGRX needs to be installed
5.  ng-Universal for fast loading and to store the teams, participants, old events, etc. (landing page startup faster)
6.  RXJS for the matches
7.  Abstract the breakdowns for scoring (this will have to be added to the sport information, add existing or known scoring types)
8.  Lots of work on the brackets part of the site, or rather more sport specific event types
9.  Break out the pools (betting from the event site but have seamless api)
10. Payment system to make it easy to get money and share money
